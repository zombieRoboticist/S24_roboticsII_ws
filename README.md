# S24_roboticsII
ROS2 Workspace for S24 RoboticsII

## Fork the repository

Press the `Fork` on the page and fork the repo to your account. This will create a repository with exact same content in your github account.

## Cloning the repository 
On the robot, open a new terminal (via VNC or SSH)
```
cd ~/codes
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ACCOUNT/S24_roboticsII_ws.git [team_name]_ws
```

## Building the ROS2 workspace
The step will build and ROS2 workspace and compile the packages.

**Docker**: Open/access a docker container via a terminal (VNC or SSH)
```
cd ~/codes/[team_name]_ws
colcon build
```

**Important**: You have to compile the package **EVERYTIME** you modify the code, even the code is written in **PYTHON**. You can simply build one specific package using the following command. (So you don't have to compile ALL packages.)
```
colcon build --packages-select [package_name]
```
The [package_name] are for example, `object_detection`, `tracking_control`.

## Activate ROS2 environment
Activate ROS2 environment to run ROS software

**Important**: You have to activate ROS2 environment **EVERYTIME** you open a new terminal and run/access the docker container.

The reason you don't need to do this while doing previous mini project is that there's an ROS activation command in `/root/.bashrc` in the docker container. Whenever a terminal is launched, it will exected this bash script once.

**Docker**: Open/access a docker container via a terminal (VNC or SSH)
```
cd ~/codes/[team_name]_ws
source install/setup.bash
```

## Launch tracking nodes!

### Color Detection and Tracking Node
**Docker**: Open a terminal and access docker (via VNC or SSH). Remeber to **Activate ROS2 environment**.
```
ros2 launch tracking_control tracking_color_object_launch.py
```

### Teleoperation node
**Docker**: Open another terminal and access docker (via VNC or SSH). Remeber to **Activate ROS2 environment**. In this node, you can control the robot and activate/deactive tracking.
```
ros2 run tracking_control joy_safety_ctrl
```
### Launch the robot and camera
**Docker**: Open another terminal and access docker (via VNC or SSH).
For the old camera model (astra pro, Robot 1~6)
```
ros2 launch tracking_control car_camera_pro_bringup_launch.py
```
For the new camera model (astra pro plus, Robot 7~)
```
ros2 launch tracking_control car_camera_proplus_bringup_launch.py
```
